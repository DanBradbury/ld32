4.	An Unconventional Weapon
  - Her strongest power is not the weapons she weilds. She doesn't feel safe because of the armor she wears. Her power comes from her mental ability and her power of speach
    - Physical combat is possible to deter and kill enemies but in times of need her true strength lies in her ability to come up with the perfect words to get out of any situation.
  - She is unaware of her true power until she is put into a terrible situation (some tragic event would be nice :P) where she was about to die but used her special power to survive.
    - Introduction to basic movement and systems
  THE TRAGIC EVENT
  - After the event she is on a mission to enact somesort of revenge on a particular enemy (most likely Gargantua)
  - It must be explained to her that she has been given a gift by the gods to be able to speak the lost ancient words of truth. All words of truth are written on tombs around the world and can be learned from.
    - Each tome has a special power that will unlock new sections of the world and allow her to defeat enemies that were previoiusly impossible.
  - Once the proper tomes have been unlocked you will be able to open the bosses mouth (dungeon will transition from closed to open with the last tome)
  FINAL BOSS ENCOUNTER will rely entirely on the players ability to "outsmart" the boss.
  - Once defeating the enemy a slow fadeout should occur to transition to "Star Wars" like text to explain the following:
    - More evil remains outside of the forest of her once safe home. After restoring safety to the land she was off to remove the encroaching evils from neighboring lands..
